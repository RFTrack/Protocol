# Protocol
As an tracker move about the world, it encounters many Signals sources that contain UUIDs that can be used to triangulate it's location! Things like WiFi BSSIDs, and connections established between stational Wifi clients and Internet-of-Things devices. These are all emitting signals! We create a global map of all these signal sources, using GPS enabled drones or vehicles (smart cars). Then a tracker device only has to have 2 interfaces: a WiFi reciever & a LoRa Transmitter. The Tracker collects the UUIDs of the local signals around it & metadata including information about the relative Strength of the signals, and transmits these UUIDs over Long range Radio! A reciever on the other end picks up these Radio packets, and compares the UUIDs and metadata to the global Database (Blockchain). It can now use this to Triangulate the tracker and display it on a map! Tracker clients can for example be a browser, Automotive HUD, or Smartphone app, or even Augmented reality!

This whole process can be Encrypted and each Tracker is paired to a private encryption keys! The Transmitter Packets are routed to a cloud server and the owner of the decryption keys. Thus making a secure & private tracking system!
